## Instruction for testing the web client locally with a deployed adria-server
* Open the adria-client in phpstorm
  * Copy the following settings to **config.json** (make sure to replace the XX)
```json
      {
        "host": "https://project-2.ti.howest.be",
        "folder": "",
        "year": "",
        "group": "adria-XX"
      }
```
  * Navigate to the index.html
  * Click on a browser icon at the top right of your IDE to host the adria-client.
  * Make sure to undo the settings once you are done testing the remote server!

## Instructions for local quality checks
You can run the validators for html, CSS and JS rules locally. 

Make sure **npm** is installed.

There is no need to push to the server to check if you are compliant with our rules. 

In the interest of sparing the server, please result to local testing as often as possible. 

If everyone pushes to test, the remote will not last. 

Open a terminal in your IDE
  - Make sure you are in the root folder of the client project.
  - Execute `npm install` this step is only needed once.
  - Execute `npm run validate-local` for linux/mac users.
  - Execute `npm run validate-local-win` for Windows users. 
  - If there are errors, the program execution will halt and show the first error
  - If there are no errors, a report file will be generated in the `.scannerworks/` directory. 
    - You will find the link to the sonar report in this file 

Hint:

If you want to skip ci remotely, include `[ci skip]` in your commit message. 

This is convenient for when you want to quickly add a certain commit, but do not wish to trigger the whole CI sequence. 

## Default files

### CSS 
The `reset.css` has already been supplied, but it's up to you and your team to add other styles. 

### JavaScript
A demonstration for connecting with the API has already been set up. 

We urge you to divide your JS files into many small JS files.
